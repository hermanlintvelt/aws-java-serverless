# Java AWS Lambda with Serverless.com Tutorial

In which we build a *Roadmaps API* using:

* Java (11)
* AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, API GW, SSM
* Serverless.com

This project aims to show how to deploy a basic API using AWS serverless services, and [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com) to deploy it.

## Setup

### Installation Setup

In order to do this tutorial, you need to install a few things:

* Install node and npm
* Install the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com) installed with an AWS account set up.
* Install Java 11 JDK (OpenJDK is good)
* Install [Gradle](http://gradle.org) (_You can use [Maven](https://maven.org) as well to build your Java artifact._)

### Configuration Setup

* Create AWS account and setup credentials for *Serverless* using [this great article on how to setup Serverless to work with AWS](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/).
