# Java AWS Lambda with Serverless.com Tutorial

## AWS SDK for Java 1.x

This tutorial repo started by using AWS SDK for Java v1 - you can still get hold of it in the `aws-sdk-1` directory.

See the [AWS-SDK-1](aws-sdk-1) folder.

## AWS SDK for Java 2.x

This is a major rewrite of the 1.x SDK for Java. See [the AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/home.html) for more information about this version.

See the [AWS-SDK-2](aws-sdk-2) folder for a tutorial on using the 2.x sdk.
